    I am a <strong>PhD Candidate in Sociology</strong> at 
    <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/sociology-anthropology.html" target="_blank">Concordia University</a>, 
    a <strong>CAnD3 Doctoral Fellow</strong> at 
    <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/cand3/our-people/fellows-2024-25" target="_blank">McGill University</a>, 
    and a <strong>CRDCN Emerging Scholar</strong> at the 
    <a href="https://crdcn.ca" target="_blank">Canadian Research Data Centre Network (CRDCN)</a>. My doctoral research is focused on the 
    <strong>social determinants of mental health</strong> and population-level <strong>disparities in mental health outcomes</strong>, particularly psychological distress, anxiety, and depression among <strong>youth</strong> and <strong>young adults</strong> in Canada. I use statistical modeling and machine learning to analyze such disparities and recommend data-driven and evidence-based policies to improve the mental health of youth and young adults at the population level.

    My doctoral research has been supported by funding from 
    <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/sociology-anthropology.html" target="_blank">Concordia University</a>, 
    <a href="https://www.frq.gouv.qc.ca" target="_blank">Fonds de recherche du Québec – Société et Culture (FRQSC)</a>, 
    the <a href="https://www.ciqss.org" target="_blank">Quebec Interuniversity Center for Social Statistics (QICSS)</a>, 
    and the <a href="https://crdcn.ca" target="_blank">Canadian Research Data Centre Network (CRDCN)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Methodologically, I am interested in <strong>quantitative research methods</strong>, <strong>survey methodology</strong>, 
    <strong>applied social statistics</strong>, and <strong>machine learning</strong>, with a focus on official large-scale surveys with complex sampling designs.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a university lecturer, I teach courses in <strong>Sociological Theory</strong>, <strong>Sociology of Health</strong>, 
    <strong>Social Statistics</strong>, <strong>Quantitative Research Methods</strong>, 
    <strong>Survey Methodology</strong>, and <strong>Critical Data Studies</strong>, with an emphasis on connecting course material to real-world applications. In my courses, I incorporate <strong>experiential learning</strong> to provide students with more opportunities to work with real-world data on topics such as income inequality, food insecurity, housing, and disparities in health outcomes, allowing them to see the impact their work can have in creating a more 
    <strong>functional</strong>, <strong>just</strong>, and <strong>healthier society</strong>.
