I am a **PhD Candidate in Sociology** at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/sociology-anthropology.html), a **CAnD3 Doctoral Fellow** at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/cand3/our-people/fellows-2024-25), and a **CRDCN Emerging Scholar** at the [Canadian Research Data Centre Network (CRDCN)](https://crdcn.ca). My doctoral research is focused on the **social determinants of mental health** and population-level disparities in mental health outcomes, particularly psychological distress, anxiety, and depression among youth and young adults in Canada. I use statistical modeling and machine learning to analyze such disparities and recommend data-driven and evidence-based policies to improve the mental health of youth and young adults at the population level.

My doctoral research has been supported by funding from [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/sociology-anthropology.html), [Fonds de recherche du Québec – Société et Culture (FRQSC)](https://www.frq.gouv.qc.ca), the [Quebec Interuniversity Center for Social Statistics (QICSS)](https://www.ciqss.org), and the [Canadian Research Data Centre Network (CRDCN)](https://crdcn.ca).  

Methodologically, I am interested in quantitative research methods, survey methodology, applied social statistics, and machine learning, with a focus on official large-scale surveys with complex sampling designs.

As a university lecturer, I teach courses in **Sociological Theory**, **Applied Social Statistics**, **Quantitative Research Methods**, **Survey Methodology**, and **Critical Data Studies**, with an emphasis on connecting course material to real-world applications. In my courses, I incorporate **experiential learning** to provide students with more opportunities to work with real-world data on topics such as income inequality, food insecurity, housing, and disparities in health outcomes, allowing them to see the impact their work can have in creating a more **functional**, **just**, and **healthier society**.
