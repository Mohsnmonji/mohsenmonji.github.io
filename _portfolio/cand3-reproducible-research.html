## CAnD3 Reproducible Research Project

This study investigates disparities in self-rated mental health among young adults aged 18-39 in Canada, examining socio-demographic characteristics using data from the 2017 General Social Survey (Public Microdata Files). Key findings include:

- **Gender**: Females had significantly higher odds of reporting poor or fair mental health compared to males.
- **Marital Status**: Single, divorced, or widowed individuals reported higher odds of poor mental health compared to married or common-law individuals.
- **Income**: Higher household income was protective, with those earning $100k+ having significantly lower odds of poor mental health compared to those earning less than $50k.
- **Immigrant Status**: Immigrants reported lower odds of poor/fair mental health compared to non-immigrants.
- **Education**: A university degree was associated with lower odds of poor/fair mental health compared to individuals with less than a high school education.

However, visible minority status, middle household income, and high school/trade/college education levels showed no significant associations with poor/fair mental health.
