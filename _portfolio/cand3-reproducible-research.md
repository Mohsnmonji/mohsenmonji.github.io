This study investigates disparities in self-rated mental health among young adults aged 18-39 in Canada, across socio-demographic characteristics, using data from the 2017 General Social Survey, Public Microdata Files. After adjusting for age, household income, and other confounders, the results show that being female and single or divorced/ widowed were significantly associated with higher odds of reporting poor or fair mental health compared to males and those who were married or in common-law relationships, respectively.

In contrast, higher household income was protective against poor/fair mental health, with individuals in households earning $100k or more having significantly lower odds of reporting poor/fair mental health compared to those with a household income of less than $50k. Being an immigrant was also associated with lower odds of reporting poor or fair mental health compared to non-immigrants.

Regarding education, having a university degree was significantly associated with lower odds of poor/fair mental health compared to individuals with less than a high school education. No significant associations were found between visible minority status, middle household income, or educational attainment at the high school/trade/college level and poor/fair mental health.
