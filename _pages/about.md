I am a **PhD Candidate in Sociology** at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/sociology-anthropology.html), a **CAnD3 Doctoral Fellow** at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/cand3/our-people/fellows-2024-25), and a **CRDCN Emerging Scholar** at the [Canadian Research Data Centre Network (CRDCN)](https://crdcn.ca).In my PhD, I use data from national surveys to examine **population-level disparities in mental health outcomes**, particularly psychological distress, anxiety, and depression among youth and young adults in Canada. I use **statistical modeling** and **machine learning** to analyze these disparities and develop evidence-based policy recommendations to improve mental health outcomes at the population level.  

Another strand of my research explores the **relationship between technology and society**, particularly how technological innovation drives **social change** and can lead to both **social good** and **social harm**. My **methodological interests** include **quantitative research methods**, **survey methodology**, **applied social statistics**, and **machine learning**, with a focus on official surveys with **complex sampling designs**.  

My doctoral research has been supported by funding from [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/sociology-anthropology.html), [Fonds de recherche du Québec – Société et Culture (FRQSC)](https://www.frq.gouv.qc.ca), the [Quebec Interuniversity Center for Social Statistics (QICSS)](https://www.ciqss.org), and the [Canadian Research Data Centre Network (CRDCN)](https://crdcn.ca).

As a university lecturer, I teach **Social Inequalities**, **Sociology of Health**, **Quantitative Research Methods**, **Survey Methodology**, **Applied Social Statistics**, and **Technology and Society**. In my courses, I integrate **experiential learning** to connect students with real-world applications of quantitative methods and statistical modeling. My goal is to provide students with the skills they need to understand, interpret, and analyze social data, and to use statistical knowledge to make a difference and contribute to a more functional and just society.
