### About Me
I am a PhD Candidate in Sociology at Concordia University conducting research on the social determinants of mental health and disparities in mental health outcomes, particularly psychological distress, anxiety, and depression. I use statistical and machine learning modeling to analyze such disparities and recommend evidence-based policies for better mental health outcomes. 
### Research Interests

- **Social Determinants of Health**: Associations between factors such as food security, income, and community belonging with psychological distress, anxiety, and depression.
- **Youth Mental Health**: Mental health disparities among youth, with a focus on social determinants.
- **Quantitative Methodology**: Survey design, statistical and machine learning modeling.
