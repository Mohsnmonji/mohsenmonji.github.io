I am a **PhD Candidate in Sociology** at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/sociology-anthropology.html), a **CAnD3 Doctoral Fellow** at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/cand3/our-people/fellows-2024-25), and a **CRDCN Emerging Scholar** at the [Canadian Research Data Centre Network (CRDCN)](https://crdcn.ca), conducting research on the social determinants of mental health and population-level disparities in mental health outcomes, particularly **psychological distress**, **anxiety**, and **depression** among **youth** and **young adults** in Canada. I use **statistical modeling** and **machine learning** to analyze such disparities and recommend evidence-based policies to improve mental health outcomes at the population level.
