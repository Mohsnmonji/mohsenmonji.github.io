I am a **PhD Candidate in Sociology** at Concordia University and a **CAnD3 Doctoral Fellow** at McGill University, conducting research on the social determinants of mental health and disparities in mental health outcomes, particularly psychological distress, anxiety, and depression among youth. I use **statistical modeling** and **machine learning** to analyze such disparities and recommend evidence-based policies for better mental health outcomes at the population level. My doctoral research has been supported by funding from **Concordia University**, **Fonds de recherche du Québec – Société et Culture (FRQSC)**, and the **Quebec Interuniversity Center for Social Statistics(QICSS)**.

**Methodologically**, I am interested in **quantitative research methods**, **survey statistics and methodology**, and **applied social statistics**, with a focus on analyzing official survey data while addressing challenges such as complex sampling, weighting, and nonresponse bias.

I teach **Sociology of Health**, **Quantitative Research Methods**, and **Applied Social Statistics**. In my courses, I integrate **experiential learning** to connect students with real-world applications of quantitative methods and statistical modeling. My goal is to provide students with the skills they need to understand, interpret, and analyze social data, and to use statistical knowledge to make a difference and contribute to a more functional and just society.
