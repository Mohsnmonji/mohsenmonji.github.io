# Teaching

As a university lecturer, I teach quantitative research methods and applied statistics. In my courses, I integrate experiential learning to connect students with real-world applications of statistical knowledge. My goal is to provide students with the skills they need to understand, interpret, and analyze social data and use statistical knowledge to make a difference and contribute to a more functional and just society.
