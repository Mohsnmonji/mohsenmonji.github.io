## **Teaching Philosophy**

I approach teaching as an encouraging and enjoyable learning experience where students feel supported in developing their skills. I teach **Sociology of Health**, **Quantitative Research Methods**, and **Applied Social Statistics**, with an emphasis on connecting course material to real-world applications.

In my courses, I incorporate **experiential learning** to provide students with more opportunities to work with real-world data to examine a wide range of topics, such as income inequality, food insecurity, housing, and disparities in health outcomes. I believe this hands-on approach not only helps students build technical expertise but also gives them a chance to see the impact that their learning can have in the world.

I value slow and thoughtful learning and encourage students to take the time to engage with the concepts and methods they are exposed to in the course. My goal is to create a learning environment where students feel confident and inspired to learn.
