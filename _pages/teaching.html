  <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
  <p>I teach <strong>Sociology of Health</strong>, <strong>Quantitative Research Methods</strong>, and <strong>Applied Social Statistics</strong>, with an emphasis on connecting course material to real-world applications. I approach teaching as an enjoyable experience where students feel encouraged to learn and develop their skills.</p>

  <p>In my courses, I incorporate <strong>experiential learning</strong> to provide students with more opportunities to work with real-world data to examine topics such as income inequality, food insecurity, housing, and disparities in health outcomes. I believe this hands-on approach not only helps students build technical expertise but also gives them a chance to see the impact their learning can have in the world.</p>

  <p>I value slow and thoughtful learning and want students to engage with the concepts and methods they are exposed to.</p>
