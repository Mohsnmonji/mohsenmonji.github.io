## TEACHING PHILOSOPHY

I teach **Sociology of Health**, **Quantitative Research Methods**, **Survey Methodology**, and **Applied Social Statistics**, with an emphasis on connecting course material to real-world applications. I approach teaching as an enjoyable experience where students feel encouraged to learn and develop their skills.

In my courses, I incorporate **experiential learning** to provide students with more opportunities to work with real-world data to examine topics such as income inequality, food insecurity, housing, and disparities in health outcomes. I believe this hands-on approach not only helps students build technical expertise but also gives them a chance to see the impact their learning can have in the world.

I value slow and thoughtful learning and want students to engage with the concepts and methods they are exposed to.
