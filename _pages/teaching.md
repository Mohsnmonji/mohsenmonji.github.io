## TEACHING PHILOSOPHY

I approach teaching as an enjoyable experience where students feel encouraged to learn and develop their skills. In my courses, I incorporate **experiential learning** to provide students with more opportunities to work with real-world data to examine topics such as income inequality, food insecurity, housing, and disparities in health outcomes. I believe this hands-on approach not only helps students build technical expertise but also gives them a chance to see the impact their work can have in creating a more functional, just, and healthier society.

I value slow and thoughtful learning and want students to engage with the concepts and methods they are exposed to.
