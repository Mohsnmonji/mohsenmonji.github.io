### Introduction

Logistic regression is a statistical method used for modeling binary outcomes, such as:

- Predicting whether an individual is diagnosed with anxiety or not.
- Examining disparities in employment status.

It’s widely used in social science research for understanding and predicting categorical outcomes.

### Logistic Regression Formula

Logistic regression uses the following equation:

<p>$$
P(Y = 1) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1X)}}
$$</p>

Where:

- <p>\( Y \)</p>: Binary outcome variable  
- <p>\( X \)</p>: Predictor variable  
- <p>\( \beta_0, \beta_1 \)</p>: Model coefficients

### Example in R

Here’s how to run a simple logistic regression in R:

```r
# Load necessary library
library(tidyverse)

# Sample data
data <- tibble(
  outcome = c(1, 0, 1, 0),
  predictor = c(5, 3, 8, 6)
)

# Logistic regression
model <- glm(outcome ~ predictor, data = data, family = binomial)
summary(model)
```

The glm() function in R fits a generalized linear model, with the family = binomial argument specifying logistic regression.

Interpretation

The coefficients <p>\( \beta_0, \beta_1 \)</p> from the output of the logistic regression can be interpreted as follows:
	•	

<p>\( \beta_0 \)</p>: The intercept, representing the log-odds of the outcome when the predictor is zero.  



	•	

<p>\( \beta_1 \)</p>: The change in log-odds for a one-unit increase in the predictor variable.  




Exponentiating the coefficients gives the odds ratio, which represents how the odds of the outcome change with a one-unit increase in the predictor variable. For example:

<p>$$
\text{Odds Ratio} = e^{\beta_1}
$$</p>


If the odds ratio is greater than 1, the predictor increases the likelihood of the outcome. If it is less than 1, the predictor decreases the likelihood of the outcome.

Conclusion

Logistic regression is a powerful and versatile tool for analyzing binary outcomes in social science research. By understanding and interpreting the coefficients, researchers can uncover relationships between predictors and outcomes.
