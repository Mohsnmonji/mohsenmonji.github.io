### Introduction

Survey data often come with **complex sampling designs**, including stratification, clustering, and unequal probabilities of selection. To make valid population-level inferences, **survey weights** must be applied. This page focuses on understanding survey weights and bootstrap weights, and how to use them effectively in **R** with the `survey` package.

### Key Concepts

#### What Are Survey Weights?

Survey weights adjust for unequal probabilities of selection, nonresponse, and post-stratification. They help ensure that the results represent the target population accurately.

- **Weighting Formula**:  
  $$ w_i = \frac{1}{p_i} $$  
  where \( p_i \) is the probability of selection for unit \( i \).

#### Types of Survey Weights

1. **Sampling Weights**: Correct for unequal probabilities of selection.  
2. **Post-Stratification Weights**: Adjust for known population totals (e.g., age, gender).  
3. **Replication Weights**: Used for variance estimation in complex surveys.

#### Bootstrap Weights

Bootstrap weights allow for variance estimation when traditional Taylor Series Linearization is challenging. They involve resampling the data multiple times with replacement to calculate standard errors.

### Example: Using Survey Weights in R

Let’s work with an example dataset to understand how to apply survey weights using the `survey` package.

```r
# Install and load the necessary package
install.packages("survey")
library(survey)

# Example dataset
data <- data.frame(
  id = 1:6,
  weight = c(1.2, 1.5, 0.8, 1.1, 1.3, 1.0), # Survey weights
  cluster = c(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3),             # Clustering
  strata = c(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3),              # Stratification
  income = c(50000, 55000, 60000, 58000, 62000, 63000)
)
```

Define survey design

```r
design <- svydesign(
  ids = ~cluster,         # Clustering
  strata = ~strata,       # Stratification
  weights = ~weight,      # Survey weights
  data = data
)
```

Mean income estimate

```r

mean_income <- svymean(~income, design)
print(mean_income)
```

## Variance Estimation Using Bootstrap Weights

In cases where bootstrap weights are provided, the survey package can handle them effectively.


# Bootstrap weights example

```r
data$bootstrap_weights <- matrix(runif(60, 0.8, 1.2), nrow = 6) # Simulated bootstrap weights

# Define survey design with bootstrap weights
bootstrap_design <- svrepdesign(
  data = data,
  weights = ~weight,
  repweights = "bootstrap_weights",
  type = "bootstrap"
)

# Mean income estimate with bootstrap weights
bootstrap_mean <- svymean(~income, bootstrap_design)
print(bootstrap_mean)
```

## Visualization

Visualizing survey-weighted results can provide more insight. Here’s an example using the ggplot2 package.

```r
# Install and load ggplot2
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

# Weighted histogram
ggplot(data, aes(x = income, weight = weight)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5000, fill = "#1B5E20", color = "white") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Weighted Income Distribution",
    x = "Income",
    y = "Weighted Count"
  )
```

Tips for Handling Survey Weights
	1.	Always check your dataset documentation to understand how weights are calculated and what they represent.
	2.	Use replication weights when they are provided, especially for bootstrap or jackknife variance estimation.
	3.	R Functions to Remember:
	•	svydesign(): For traditional survey design.
	•	svrepdesign(): For replication-based designs (e.g., bootstrap).
	•	svymean(), svytotal(), svyglm(): To calculate weighted estimates.

Conclusion

Properly accounting for survey weights is crucial for valid statistical inference in social science research. The survey package in R provides powerful tools for analyzing complex survey data. With a good understanding of weights and replication methods, you can uncover meaningful insights from large-scale survey datasets.
